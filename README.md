The aim of this study was to investigate to what degree a machine learning model can capture outcome of a One Day International (ODI) match depending on team's composition and strength. The target competition was the World Cup 2019. A machine learning model developed to predict world cup 2019 matches. Over 2500 players batting and bowling records along with 4100 matches scorecard were analysed.  Basic features comprising of batting and bowling metrics was used along with features capturing the impact and quality of players.
